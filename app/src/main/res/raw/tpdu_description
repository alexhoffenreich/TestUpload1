        <h1>Trolley Power Distribution Unit – TPDU</h1>
        <p>This section describes the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location of the TPDU</li>
            <li>External structure of the TPDU</li>
            <li>Internal structure of the TPDU</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Purpose of the TPDU</h2>
        <p>The TPDU performs the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Receives 230VAC supply from the generator or mains supply and transfers it to the PSC.
            </li>

            <li>Receives 28V DC from the PSC for distribution to trolley components.</li>

            <li>In case of generator or mains power failure, receives 21-24VDC from the battery pack for
                distribution to trolley components.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Location of the TPDU</h2>

        <p>The TPDU is located in the Power Supply and Distribution Compartment at the forward left hand
            side of the trolley.
        </p>

        <h2>External Structure of the TPDU</h2>

        <p>The TPDU includes a front panel and rear panel.</p>
        <h3>Front Panel of the TPDU</h3>
        <p>The front panel of the TPDU includes the following sections:</p>
        <li>• TPDU POWER USAGE (1)</li>

        <li>• 230V AC LOADS switches (shown as 220) (2)</li>

        <li>• CONTROL Panel (3)</li>

        <li>• 28V DC LOADS switches (shown as 24) (4)</li>

        <li>• POWER STATUS (5)</li>

        <li>• Power sockets + emergency push button (6)</li>
